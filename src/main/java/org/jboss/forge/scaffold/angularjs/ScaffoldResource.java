 * An abstraction of a resource used by the Scaffold provider. The scaffold resources will specify the source from where they

 * 
 * This abstraction is meant to reduce the verbosity involved in using the {@link ScaffoldUtil} class, since resource paths can
 * now be stored and passed around in collections, and iterated through.
